<h1>Top Videogames of All Time According to Odd</h1>
<h2>Three of my favorite games.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Psychonauts</h3>
<p>Incredibly funny, great writing, and a unique style that holds up today.</p>

<h3>Elden Ring</h3>
<p>Felt like I was a kid again, gave me that wonder of exploration that many games try to emulate but struggle to properly do.</p>

<h3>Hollow Knight</h3>
<p>I couldn't put it down except to sleep, a beautiful world filled with all kinds of mysteries and incredibly simple, yet challenging combat.</p>
